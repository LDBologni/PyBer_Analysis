# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the project

The project Data Analyst at PyBer would require to  determine various statistics calculations for example, mean, median and mode, using Pandas libraries, Numpy, and Scipy.

In addition, the project requires to create graphs of the following type:
- Bubble graph
- Bar graph
- Pie chart
- Line graph
- Scatter plot graph
- Box & Whisker plots 
 
To create the graphs it would require the use of Matplotlib and Datetime.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the project is to perform an explorytory analysis on a large data set. For the analysis, several graphs would need to be created in order to showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by the type of city.


### Results

The analysis provides the following results:

- Data Frame Summary

- Percentage of Total fares by city

- Total Fare by City

### - Total Drivers :

The number of drivers increase as we are moving from Rural to Urban cities. It drivers from Urban citites constitutes the 80.9% of Pyber drivers are operating, while in Urban cities constitutes only 2.6%.

### - Average Fare per Driver :

The results shows that the average fare per driver drops significantly from Urban cities to Rural 55.49$ to 16.57$. Which translates that a driver in the rural area is far more profitable than a driver in the urban area.

### - Total Rides :

The highest numbers of rides come from Urban cities with a 68.4% of the total. A 26.3%  for Suburban cities and 5.3% for rural cities.

### - Average Fare per Ride :

On the opposite of total fares, as we are moving from Rural to Urban cities, the average fare per ride drops from 34.62$ to 24.53$. Which means rides in rural cities are more profitable.

### - Total Fares :

The highest revenue comes from the Urban cities with a 63%.
Suburban cities constitutes 30% revenue.
Rural cities constitutes only for 7% of revenue.


Urban cities seem to be saturated by drivers. It would be more profitable to review the number of drivers on Urban cities, and maybe to reallocate drivers from Urban to Rural and Suburban cities, to increase profitability as the average fare /driver in Rural and Suburban cities are much above average.

Review the fare policy among cities to make sure it is adapted to the local market, and to make the Byper services more attractive on Rural and suburban cities.

Suggest some incentives to drive consistent usage and avoid having such disparities on revenues from week to week (Example: put in place a reward program per number of rides…)
